    The cheesiest pasta you've ever had!<br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li> Cavatappi noodles: we love love love the fun shape of cavatappi noodles, but feel free to use 8 oz. of whatever variety of<br> pasta your heart desires.
     <li> Heavy cream: the heavy cream is used in the roux for this cheese pasta to help make it super duper creamy. 
     <li> Shredded gouda and cheddar cheese: cheese is the star of the show for this pasta, of course! We’re using a combination of shredded<br>cheddar and shredded gouda.
     <li> Grated parmesan cheese: grated parm adds a very nice salty and cheesy flavor. Don’t skip this!
     <Li> Salt & pepper: sprinkle on to your liking!
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <Li><h3>Boil Pasta</h3>
      Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the pasta to the water and cook the noodles until al dente and then strain noodles.  </Li>
      <li><h3>Make The Roux</h3>
      Heat a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the heavy cream and heat for about 1 minute and then mix the cheeses into the warmed <br>
      cream and mix until the cheese has melted. YUM.</li>
      <Li><h3>Combine Pasta And Cheese Sauce</h3>
      Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the cooked noodles and mix to combine. Serve immediately, and enjoy! </li>
